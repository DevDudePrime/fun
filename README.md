Unzip the "corona extension.zip" file where you can find it!!!!
To install the extension in Firefox type "about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox" in the addressbar. Click the "Load Temperary Add-on..." Button and load the manifest.json file.
In Chrome type chrome://extensions/ in the addressbar. Enable Developer mode by clicking on the slider in the top right of the page. Click the "Load unpacked" button and load the manifest.json file.

Version 1.
This works on page load so it will not work on most social sites. :'(
